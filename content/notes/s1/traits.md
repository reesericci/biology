## Traits

### Dominant

Dominant traits are traits that when present in a gene, always take precedence over the recessive trait. These are usually denoted by an uppercase letter.

### Recessive

Recessive traits are traits that require the dominant trait to not be present in order to show. These are usually denoted with a lowercase letter

## Punnett Squares

Punnett squares are a tool for predicting the likelihood of a trait being present in an offspring.

In a punnett square, there is a square cross with one parent's trait on the top, and the other parent's trait on the side. In each section of the cross, there is the resulting trait for the offspring. Each square has a 25% likelihood of appearing in an offspring.

**Example**:

> In this example of a punnett square, **A or a** is the trait being crossed, where the uppercase **A** is the dominant trait, and the lowercase **a** is the recessive trait.

## Mendelian vs Non-Mendelian genetics

### Mendelian

Mendelian genetics is your normal genetics, simple and straightforward. Either the trait appears or it doesn't. There's no in-between.

### Non-Mendelian

In Non-Mendelian genetics, traits aren't binary, they represent things like height and eye color which can vary from person-to person. There are multiple types of Non-Mendelian genetics:

#### Codominance

#### Incomplete Dominance

## Crossing multiple traits

It's fairly easy to scale up  the crossing of traits. All you have to do is make individual punnett squares for each trait and then multiply the probabilities.
