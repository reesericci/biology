Make sure after every lab to smash at least 1 (one) beaker.\n\n### Stirring Rod\n\nA stirring rod is for stirring things that you can't touch.\n\n![Stirring rod image](/stirringrod.png)\n\n\n\n\n### Beaker\n\nA beaker is for containering things, mainly liquids and chemicals.\n\n![Beaker image](/beaker.png)\n\n### Pipette\n\nPipettes are for transferring liquids without contamination.\n\n![Pipette image](/pipette.png)\n\n\n\n### Flask\n\nIt's like a beaker, but less likely to spill and things.\n\n![Flask image](/flask.png)\n\n### Graduated Cylinder\n\nA graduated cylinder is for holding liquids to measure them easily\n\n![Graduated Cylinder image](/gc.png)\n\n### Test Tube\n\nA test tube is a small thing for holding small liquids and transferring them.\n\n![Test Tube image](/testtube.png)\n\n### Test Tube Rack\n\nIt protects you from yourself, by making sure you don't drop the test tubes with chemicals in them.\n\n![Test tube rack image](/ttr.png)","lastmodified":"2022-12-15T05:30:52.502323848Z","tags":null},"/notes/s1/traits":{"title":"Traits","content":"\n## Traits\n\n### Dominant\n\nDominant traits are traits that when present in a gene, always take precedence over the recessive trait. These are usually denoted by an uppercase letter.\n\n### Recessive\n\nRecessive traits are traits that require the dominant trait to not be present in order to show. These are usually denoted with a lowercase letter\n\n## Punnett Squares\n\nPunnett squares are a tool for predicting the likelihood of a trait being present in an offspring.\n\nIn a punnett square, there is a square cross with one parent's trait on the top, and the other parent's trait on the side. In each section of the cross, there is the resulting trait for the offspring. Each square has a 25% likelihood of appearing in an offspring.\n\n**Example**:\n\n![punnett.png](/punnett.png)\n\n\u003e [!info]\n\u003e In this example of a punnett square, **A or a** is the trait being crossed, where the uppercase **A** is the dominant trait, and the lowercase **a** is the recessive trait.\n\n## Mendelian vs Non-Mendelian genetics\n\n### Mendelian\n\nMendelian genetics is your normal genetics, simple and straightforward. Either the trait appears or it doesn't. There's no in-between.\n\n### Non-Mendelian\n\nIn Non-Mendelian genetics, traits aren't binary, they represent things like height and eye color which can vary from person-to person. There are multiple types of Non-Mendelian genetics:\n\n#### Codominance\n\n#### Incomplete Dominance\n\n## Crossing multiple traits\n\nIt's fairly easy to scale up  the crossing of traits. All you have to do is make individual punnett squares for each trait and then multiply the probabilities.\n\n![Multiple traits image](multitraits.png)\n\n\nContinue to the next part -\u003e [[DNA]]","lastmodified":"2022-12-15T05:30:52.502323848Z","tags":null}}
